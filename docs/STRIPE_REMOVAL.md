# Stripe Removal - Payment-Free Booking System

> **Date**: October 4, 2025
> **Status**: ✅ Complete
> **Focus**: Perfecting the booking system without payment dependencies

---

## 🎯 Objective

Remove all Stripe payment dependencies to focus on building a perfect booking system. Payment integration will be added later once the core booking flow is flawless.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**Removed Stripe-related columns**:
- `users.stripe_customer_id`
- `users.stripe_subscription_id`
- `registrations.stripe_payment_intent_id`
- `bookings.stripe_payment_intent_id`

**Files Modified**:
- `shared/schema.ts` - Removed Stripe field definitions

**Database Migration**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS stripe_customer_id;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS stripe_subscription_id;
ALTER TABLE registrations DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS stripe_payment_intent_id;
ALTER TABLE bookings DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS stripe_payment_intent_id;
```

---

### 2. Dependencies Removed

**Removed npm packages**:
- `@stripe/react-stripe-js`
- `@stripe/stripe-js`
- `stripe` (server-side)

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json` - Removed Stripe packages
- Ran `npm install` to clean up dependencies

---

### 3. Server-Side Code Cleanup

**Removed from `server/routes.ts`**:
1. Stripe import: `import Stripe from "stripe";`
2. Stripe initialization code
3. Payment intent route: `/api/create-payment-intent`
4. Stripe webhook handler: `/api/stripe/webhook`

**Total lines removed**: ~80 lines of payment-specific code

---

### 4. Current Booking Flow

**Simplified Registration Flow** (class-detail.tsx):

```typescript
const registerMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("/api/registrations", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      credentials: "include",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        classId: classItem.id,
        paymentAmount: classItem.template.price,
        paymentStatus: "pending",
        status: "pending",
      }),
    });
    return response.json();
  },
  onSuccess: () => {
    toast({
      title: "Spot Reserved!",
      description: "Your registration is confirmed. Payment will be collected at the door.",
    });
  },
});
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Instant reservation (no payment required)
- ✅ Payment status set to "pending"
- ✅ Payment collected at the door
- ✅ Simple, fast booking experience

## 📊 Database Schema (Current)

### `registrations` Table

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| classId | UUID | Foreign key to classes |
| clientId | UUID | Foreign key to users |
| status | enum | `pending`, `confirmed`, `cancelled` |
| paymentStatus | enum | `pending`, `paid`, `refunded` |
| paymentAmount | integer | Price in ISK (whole numbers) |
| attended | boolean | Whether user attended |
| notes | text | Optional notes |
| createdAt | timestamp | Registration time |
| updatedAt | timestamp | Last update time |

**Payment Tracking**:
- `paymentStatus: "pending"` → Payment due at door
- `paymentStatus: "paid"` → Payment collected (will be updated manually by admin)
- `paymentAmount` → Stored for reference, payment collected offline

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Changes

### Class Detail Page (class-detail.tsx)

**Booking Sidebar Text**:
```tsx
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Payment at the door</p>

<div className="border-t pt-4 space-y-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  <p>✓ Instant confirmation</p>
  <p>✓ Pay at the door (cash or card)</p>
  <p>✓ Free cancellation up to 24h before</p>
  <p>✓ Email confirmation sent</p>
</div>
```

**Success Message**:
```
"Spot Reserved! Your registration is confirmed. Payment will be collected at the door."
```

---

## 🔄 Admin Workflow

### Payment Collection Process

1. **User Books Class**:
   - Registration created with `paymentStatus: "pending"`
   - Spot reserved instantly
   - No payment required online

2. **Before Class**:
   - Admin sees list of registrations with payment status
   - Can mark payments as "paid" when collected

3. **At Door** (Manual Process):
   - Collect payment via cash or card terminal
   - Update registration: `paymentStatus: "paid"`

4. **Payment Tracking**:
   - Admin dashboard shows payment status for all registrations
   - Can filter by "pending" payments
   - Revenue tracking still accurate

- Can switch between payment methods later
- Option to add Stripe, Truelayer, or other providers

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Test Booking Flow**:
   - Create test class
   - Test registration as client
   - Verify email notifications (if implemented)
   - Test cancellation flow

2. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - View all registrations with payment status
   - Mark payments as "paid" manually
   - Track revenue and capacity

3. **Email Notifications**:
   - Registration confirmation email
   - Class reminder (24h before)
   - Cancellation confirmation
   - Use Resend (FREE - 100 emails/day)

### Future Payment Integration

When ready to add online payments, options include:

1. **Stripe** (easiest):
   - Add back Stripe packages
   - Implement payment flow
   - ~2.2% transaction fees

2. **Truelayer** (lowest fees for Iceland):
   - Bank transfer API
   - FREE tier (10k transactions/month)
   - ~0.1% effective fees
   - See `PAYMENT_STRATEGY.md` for details

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Optional 30% deposit online (Stripe)
   - Remainder at door (cash/card)
   - Reduces no-shows
   - Lower fees than full online payment

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Files
- `shared/schema.ts` - Removed Stripe fields
- `server/routes.ts` - Removed Stripe routes and initialization
- `package.json` - Removed Stripe dependencies

### Database
- Direct SQL to remove Stripe columns (4 ALTER TABLE statements)

### Client Files (No changes needed)
- `client/src/pages/class-detail.tsx` - Already uses "pay at door" messaging
- `client/src/pages/client-dashboard.tsx` - Shows payment status correctly
- `client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx` - Admin can manage registrations

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Database schema updated (Stripe columns removed)
- [x] Dependencies removed from package.json
- [x] Server routes cleaned (no Stripe initialization)
- [x] Dev server starts without errors
- [ ] Create test class as admin

---

## 📝 Notes

### Why This Approach?

1. **User Request**: "lets focus on making the booking system perfect!"
2. **Simplicity**: Easier to test and debug without payment complexity
3. **Cost Savings**: Zero transaction fees during development and initial launch
4. **Flexibility**: Can add payments later when booking system is solid

### Migration Path

When ready to add payments:
1. Review `PAYMENT_STRATEGY.md` for fee optimization
2. Choose payment provider (Stripe, Truelayer, or hybrid)
3. Add back schema fields for payment tracking
4. Implement payment flow
5. Test thoroughly before going live
