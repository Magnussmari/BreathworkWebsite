## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Payment Failures

**Check:**
1. Stripe webhooks receiving events
2. Webhook signature verification passing
3. Database booking status updating correctly
4. Error logs for payment processing errors

**Fix:**
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check webhook signing secret
- Test with Stripe test cards first
- Review Stripe dashboard for failed payments

### Issue: Authentication Errors

**Check:**
1. OIDC redirect URIs match production URL
2. Session secret is set correctly
3. Database user table has correct data
4. Cookies are being set properly

**Fix:**
- Update redirect URIs in OIDC provider settings
- Clear browser cookies and test again
- Verify session secret is consistent across restarts
- Check HTTPS is enforced

### Issue: Database Connection Errors

**Check:**
1. Connection string is correct
2. Database is accessible from production server
3. Firewall rules allow connections
4. Connection pool not exhausted

**Fix:**
- Test connection with `psql $DATABASE_URL`
- Check Supabase firewall settings
- Restart application to reset connection pool
- Consider upgrading database tier if connection limit reached

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Check:**
1. Database query performance
2. Network latency
3. Unoptimized queries (N+1 problems)
4. Large bundle sizes

**Fix:**
- Use Drizzle Studio to analyze slow queries
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Enable query caching where appropriate
- Optimize frontend bundle with code splitting
